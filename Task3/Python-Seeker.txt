Traceback Problem 1
===================
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "stack_traces.py", line 36, in run_trace
    f()

    return x + y
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

Solution {
    * Unlike JavaScript implicit conversion is not allowed in Python when concating char or str to int and vice versa.
    * I would go to the calc function first and try to find the concat statement.
}

  File "stack_traces.py", line 15, in mult
    return x * y
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'

Solution {
    * Cannot multiply iterable with another iterable. For example, ``` [0] * 5 ``` is valid.
    * I would jump to line number line 8 and see where the wrongly typed arguments are passed.
}

Traceback Problem 4
===================

    calc(x, y)
  File "stack_traces.py", line 15, in mult
    return x * y
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'

Solution {
    * Cannot multiply iterable with another iterable. For example, ``` "abc" * 5 ``` is valid.
    * I would jump to line number line 8 and see where the wrongly typed arguments are passed.

  File "stack_traces.py", line 22, in innoc

  File "stack_traces.py", line 21, in spelunk
    raise ValueError('Invalid')
ValueError: Invalid

Solution {
    * Invalid operation was performed on char or int parameters that was passed.
    * I would zone in on "innoc" because that would be the place where the invalid operation was performed.
}

Solution {
    * zip expects iterable sequence to produce combined iterable of the shortest iterable length.
    * I would look up the function where zip was called.

    calc(x, y)
  File "stack_traces.py", line 12, in add
    return x + y
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list

Solution {
    * Only sequence of same types can be unioned (sets) or concated (lists, strings).
    * Line 30 would be my first choice because that's where the list comprehension is constructed and move to iterables that are zipped.

    return x + y
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

Solution {
    * Keys "one" & "two" contain different value types which cannot be concated withput explicit conversion.
}

}
